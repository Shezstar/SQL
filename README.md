## MySQL Project

### Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware has rapidly grown to become one of the leading companies in the electronic goods market. The company offers a wide range of products, selling through multiple channels such as retail, direct sales, and distributor networks, both online and in physical stores across various countries. 

Despite substantial growth in recent years, AtliQ has faced challenges in certain markets. To sustain growth and make more informed, data-driven decisions, the company recognizes the need to build a dedicated data analytics team.

### Objectives
- **Leverage Data for Deeper Insights**: Use data to gain a comprehensive understanding of product, customer, and market performance.
- **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide management with the data and insights necessary to make informed strategic decisions.
- **Support Growth**: Establish a data analytics team to support the company's growing needs and generate insights from ad-hoc data requests.

### Ad-Hoc Requests
This project focuses on addressing several key ad-hoc data requests from AtliQ's leadership:

1. **Product-wise Sales Report for a Given Fiscal Year**  
   A detailed report that lists the sales figures for each product in the specified fiscal year.

2. **Monthly Total Sales Report for a Given Customer**  
   A report that calculates the total monthly sales for a specified customer over time.

3. **Stored Procedure for Market Badge Classification**  
   A stored procedure that assigns a market badge (Gold or Silver) based on the total quantity sold. This helps classify high-performing markets.

4. **Top Markets, Products, and Customers by Net Sales**  
   Reports that identify the top-performing markets, products, and customers based on net sales over a specific period.

5. **Top 2 Markets by Gross Sales Using Dense Rank**  
   A query that retrieves the top 2 markets in each region, ranked by gross sales amount for the given fiscal year using the `DENSE_RANK()` function.

6. **Forecast Accuracy for All Customers**  
   A report that calculates the forecast accuracy for each customer, helping to improve demand planning and inventory management.

### Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Primary language for writing queries and stored procedures.
- **MySQL**: Database used to store, query, and manage the data.

### Conclusion
This project highlights the application of SQL to solve real-world business problems through ad-hoc requests. The insights derived from these analyses can significantly help AtliQ Hardware optimize their operations and strategize for continued future growth. By leveraging data-driven decisions, the company can make informed choices that are crucial to its success.
